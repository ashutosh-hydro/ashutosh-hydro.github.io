## About me

Ashutosh is a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of Pennsylvania State University, USA. He is interested in interdisciplinary research and teaching to understand the hydroclimatological processes and their connections to the natural-human world. Currently, he is working on a project titled ‘Predictive Risk Investigation SysteM (PRISM) for Multi-layer Dynamic Interconnection Analysis’.

He has a B Tech (Bachelor of Technology) degree in Civil Engineering from NIT Hamirpur and a M Tech (Master of Technology) degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management from IIT Guwahati. During his Ph.D. at IIT Guwahati, he proposed a new resilience-based approach to examine the response of terrestrial ecosystems to droughts.

Ashutosh has also worked at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), USA and McGill University, Canada under Water Advanced Research and Innovation (WARI) and Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute (SICI) fellowships, respectively. He has authored thirteen journal papers and three book chapters on ecohydrological resilience analysis, hydrological modeling, and climate extremes.

## Research Interests 

* Trans-domain interconnected risk assessment
