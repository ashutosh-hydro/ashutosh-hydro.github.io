I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Pennsylvania State University. I have been working in the field of hydroclimatology for five years.

I have a B Tech degree in Civil Engineering from NIT Hamirpur and a M Tech degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management from Department of Civil Engineering of IIT Guwahati. I obtained my PhD degree from IIT Guwahati on the topic ‘Assessment of the Resilience of Indian River Basins to Droughts under Climate Change Scenarios’. My thesis discussed a new method for spatiotemporal assessment of ecohydrological resilience and climatic extremes in India.

Research Interests 
======
* Trans-domain interconnected risk assessment
* Eco-hydrological resilience analysis 
* Hydrological modelling
* Climate change impact assessment
* Drought and rainfall prediction
* Applications of machine learning techniques in water resources
