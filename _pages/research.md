My research aims at advancing the understanding of hydro-climatology and its interaction with other natural-human systems. 
Specifically, my research work has focused on the resilience analysis of ecohydrological systems at different spatial scales, 
hydrological modeling, and climate change impact assessment. 
I utilize remote sensing dataset and machine learning tools to solve the hydrological problems such as risk and resilience analysis, 
hydrologic predictions. Presently, I am focusing on interdisciplinary research to identify the 
connections between different natural and human-made systems to understand 
how hydrologic risk to propagate to other domains such as ecology and agriculture. 

## My research interests are:

* Trans-domain interconnected risk assessment
* Eco-hydrological resilience analysis 
* Hydrological modelling
* Climate change impact assessment
* Drought and rainfall prediction
* Applications of machine learning techniques in water resources 

## Ecosystem resilience 

[“District-level assessment of the ecohydrological resilience to hydroclimatic disturbances and its controlling factors in India”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169418305936/) <br/>
Published in *Journal of Hydrology*<br/>
* Abstract: * The carbon and water cycles play an important role in ecosystem functioning and are linked to each other through different physical and biological processes. The hydroclimatic disturbances such as droughts affect both hydrological as well as the ecological processes. Increasing hydroclimatic disturbances under climate change will adversely affect the ecohydrological processes and hence, the assessment of the ecohydrological resilience and its controlling factors is important for the sustainability of the ecosystems. In this study, an assessment of the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems in India to hydroclimatic disturbances was carried out at the district (i.e. administrative division) scale. Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUEe), defined as the ratio of net primary productivity (NPP) to evapotranspiration, was used as an indicator of ecosystem functioning or its response to hydroclimatic disturbances. We found a large spatial variation in WUEe in India at district scale, which was significantly higher in lower Himalayan regions compared to rest of the country. Increasing trend in WUEe was found for central parts of the country. The resilience was measured in terms of the ratio of the WUEe under the dry conditions and the mean WUEe, which indicates the ability to absorb hydroclimatic disturbance. Out of 634 districts considered for this study, only 241 (~38%) districts were found resilient to dry conditions, whereas a significant reduction in WUEe was observed for some of the districts. The resilience at district scale indicates the cross-biomes response of ecosystems. In general, the forest dominated districts had higher resilience compared to districts dominated by other biome types. Also, districts having temperate climate were found having higher resilience. Out of 30 states and union territories (UTs) only 10 states had more than 50% resilient area. The results of this study highlight the need for better ecosystem management policies in the country. <br/>


[“Assessment of ecosystem resilience to hydroclimatic disturbances in India”](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.13874) <br/>
Published in *Global Change Biology* <br/>
* Abstract: * Recent studies have shown an increasing trend in hydroclimatic disturbances like droughts, which are anticipated to become more frequent and intense under global warming and climate change. Droughts adversely affect the vegetation growth and crop yield, which enhances the risks to food security for a country like India with over 1.2 billion people to feed. Here, we compared the response of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) to hydroclimatic disturbances in India at different scales (i.e., at river basins, land covers, and climate types) to examine the ecosystems’ resilience to such adverse conditions. The ecosystem water use efficiency (WUEe: NPP/Evapotranspiration) is an effective indicator of ecosystem productivity, linking carbon (C) and water cycles. We found a significant difference (p < .05) in WUEe across India at different scales. The ecosystem resilience analysis indicated that most of the river basins were not resilient enough to hydroclimatic disturbances. Drastic reduction in WUEe under dry conditions was observed for some basins, which highlighted the cross‐biome incapability to withstand such conditions. The ecosystem resilience at land cover and climate type scale did not completely relate to the basin‐scale ecosystem resilience, which indicated that ecosystem resilience at basin scale is controlled by some other ecohydrological processes. Our results facilitate the identification of the most sensitive regions in the country for ecosystem management and climate policy making, and highlight the need for taking sufficient adaptation measures to ensure sustainability of ecosystems.
